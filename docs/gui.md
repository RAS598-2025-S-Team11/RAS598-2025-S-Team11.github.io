**Test 1: GUI Working on Real-time Data**
- Faced issue with camera (not fixed)
- IMU
- LiDAR

#### 4.3 Live Sensor Visualization in GUI

The GUI aggregates multiple sensor streams into a unified dashboard. Key visualized components:

- **Object Detection Feed:**  
  Annotated Oak-D camera frames showing bounding boxes and labels.
  
- **Voice Command Status:**  
  Display of the latest interpreted command and its mapped action.
  
- **Navigation Planner View:**  
  Real-time trajectory paths generated by the navigation stack.
  
- **Sensor Diagnostics:**  
  Live data from LiDAR, IMU, and hazard modules.
