# GUI Modifications and Walkthrough

Over the course of the project, the PyQt5-based GUI evolved significantly as we integrated new sensors, added voice command capabilities, and refined real-time feedback. This table summarizes the development timeline and features added to each version.

This version-controlled design process helped us meet technical requirements while making the GUI intuitive and powerful for both debugging and live demonstration use.







#### GUI Layout & Design Concepts

**Test 1: GUI Working on Real-time Data**
- Faced issue with camera (not fixed)
- IMU
- LiDAR

_These GUI designs aim to present important real-time system data in an intuitive and user-friendly format, enabling both operator awareness and effective debugging._

#### 4.3 Live Sensor Visualization in GUI

The GUI aggregates multiple sensor streams into a unified dashboard. Key visualized components:

- **Object Detection Feed:**  
  Annotated Oak-D camera frames showing bounding boxes and labels.
  
- **Voice Command Status:**  
  Display of the latest interpreted command and its mapped action.
  
- **Navigation Planner View:**  
  Real-time trajectory paths generated by the navigation stack.
  
- **Sensor Diagnostics:**  
  Live data from LiDAR, IMU, and hazard modules.
