# Intelligent TurtleBot4 + MyCobot: Voice-Guided Mobile Manipulator Showcase üé¨

This project began as an experiment in voice-guided navigation, but rapidly evolved into a full-stack robotics platform integrating vision, voice, LiDAR, and robotic manipulation. 
Our system transformed from a basic ROS2-controlled TurtleBot4 into a multi-modal mobile manipulator equipped with the MyCobot arm, YOLOv8 object detection, Whisper-based voice transcription, and a custom-built GUI for real-time interaction and debugging.

Below is a curated collection of short demonstration videos that highlight key milestones from early testing to full-system deployment.
