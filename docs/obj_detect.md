## Object Detection with YOLOv8 ðŸ”Ž 

We implemented object detection using the YOLOv8 Nano model by Ultralytics, selected for its balance of speed and accuracy on resource-constrained hardware like the Raspberry Pi. This model performs real-time object detection from the Oak-D camera feed and publishes annotated frames along with recognized object labels.

The detection results are displayed live on our custom GUI, and the recognized labels are also logged and published to a ROS 2 topic for downstream decision-making. This enables both GUI-based visualization and voice-interactive robot behavior based on perceived objects.
